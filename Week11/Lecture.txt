<Firebase Realtime Database>

What is the difference between Firebase Realtime Database and firestore database
https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/rtdb-vs-firestore

Realtime Database stores data as one large JSON tree which makes it easier to store simple data but harder to organize complex, hierarchical data at scale.
flatten data structure allows you to prevent from you to have a nested level and much easier to get data from JSON tree


Cloud Firestore stores data in documents arranged in collections. Simple data is stored in documents, which is easy and similar to the way data is stored in JSON.
